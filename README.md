**schm** (pronounced like `scheme`) is a library for creating immutable, composable, parseable and validatable (yeah, many *ables) schemas in Node. That's highly inspired by [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) paradigm.

Play with `schm` on [RunKit](https://runkit.com/diegohaz/schm) (click on *Clone and edit this document* at the bottom and skip login if you want).

```js
const schema = require('schm')

const userSchema = schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
})

userSchema.parse({
  name: 'Haz',
  age: '27',
})
```

Output:
```js
{
  name: 'Haz',
  age: 27,
}
```

The way you declare the schema object is very similar to [mongoose Schemas](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html). So, refer to their docs to learn more.
